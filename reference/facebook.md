# Facebook Login API Documentation

In our case we will use Facebook Login for Web. It enables people to sign into our web page with their Facebook credentials.

But before we start implementing this, we'll need to create a Facebook app since an app Id is required to implement login using Facebook. You can create an app [here](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).

### Steps for creating a Facebook app

1. First of all, you'll need to login into your Facebook account.
2. Then, **click** on the **Add a New APP** button.
3. After that, fill in necessary information and click onto the **Create App ID** button.

4.Once you have created, you will see information about your newly created Facebook App with the app Id attached it. The app Id is important as it is required to implement the login.
