# Login Flow

Without a doubt, passwords are used for virtually everything we do online. Passwords protects our identities on websites, email accounts and more. Besides that, they are also used for bank transactions and making secure purchases. As time passes, more and more types of authentication and authorization method arises for example social media logins. Thus, for our case, we will have two types of login, the original login method \(username & password\) or login using social medias \(Facebook, Google, Weibo, and Wechat\).  


### Why social media login?

This is because there is no one in this world that will use a smart phone without social medias. At least when you use an Android phone you will have a Google account, no doubt. With these accounts present, it eases user in a lot of thing. For example, why create a new account in a new website where you can login with your existing social media account? You don't have to create or crack your brain remembering accounts credentials. There are thousands of websites all around the world and if you need one account each, how much would it be? Hence, the solution would be logging in using social media login.
