#Getting Started

Before you start, you will need these few things to help you with:

- Some knowledge about the programming language - **React** or you can click [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) to know more about **React**.

- You will need some knowledge on **JavaScript** too because you will have to use them during the API implementations.

But, before going on the programming languages, you will first need:

- An **editor**, e.g. **Sublime**, **Atom**, **Notepad++** and etc
- **Node.js** installed in your machine so that it can ease you during implementation part.
